K-Means Clustering and Prediction Model

Overview

This project implements K-Means clustering from scratch in C++ to analyze and group data based on similarity. Additionally, it includes a prediction model that assigns new data points to clusters.

Features

Perform K-Means clustering on a dataset

Visualize clustered data

Predict the cluster for new data points

Requirements

C++ Compiler (GCC, MSVC, or Clang)
